## About

I am an undergraduate researcher working at the intersection of **transformer architectures, reinforcement learning, and deep learning systems**.

My focus is not just using models — but understanding and implementing them from first principles. I regularly re-implement research papers to build architectural intuition and deeper mathematical clarity.

## Research Interests

- Transformer architectures  
- Reinforcement Learning  
- Representation learning  
- Optimization dynamics in deep networks  
- Scalable model training  
- Research–engineering interface  

---

## What I Do

- Implement research papers from scratch (PyTorch)
- Study attention mechanisms and training behavior
- Deliver talks on AI and modern ML systems
- Write technical blogs breaking down complex ideas
- Explore model efficiency and system-level design

---

## Current Focus

- Deep dive into attention mechanisms  
- Manual implementation of core ML architectures  
- Strengthening theoretical grounding in RL  
- Preparing for research internships in AI

## Philosophy

Reading papers builds vocabulary.  
Implementing them builds intuition.  

I believe research understanding comes from reconstruction, experimentation, and iteration.
